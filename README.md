# Advent of Code 2021 â›³

Here is my take of [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021). My personal choice was to code golf all of the challenges in Ruby, because I find it very fun and enjoyable.

### Input

All my programs read data from the standard input stream and outputs answers to the standard output stream. This makes very easy to run programs with different set of input tests, using `<` in the shell:

```shell
ruby solver.rb < test0.in
```
